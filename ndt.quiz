1) A penetrant indication, suspected of resulting from a small crack, is found in a titanium compressor blade. Which of the following NDT methods would most reliably confirm that a crack is present?
  - eddy current testing
  - magnetic particle testing
  - radiographic testing
  * ultrasonic testing

2) The tendency of a liquid penetrant to enter a discontinuity is primarily related to?
   - The viscosity of the penetrant
  * The capillary forces.
   - The chemical inertness of the penetrant.
    - The specific gravity of the penetrant.

3) The factor that has the greatest effect on the speed at which a penetrant indication forms is?
  - relative size of defect
  - type of material tested
  - type of penetrant used
  * all of the above
1) The penetrant indication for a cold shut on the surface of a casting will be:
  * A dotted or smooth continuous line.
  - A cluster of small indications.
  - A rough deep indication.
  - A large bulbous indication.

2) An important difference between non water soluble penetrants and water washable penetrants is?
  * water washable penetrants contain an emulsifier while non water soluble penetrants do not.
  - the viscosity of the two penetrants is different.
  - the colour of the two penetrants is different.
  - non water soluble penetrants are more easily removed than are water washable penetrants.

3) Water washable penetrants are the best type of penetrant to use when?
  - Maximum sensitivity and reliability are required.
  - Contamination of the parts by acid is suspected.
  * Rough surfaces are being tested.
  - Anodised parts a being tested.

4) Electrostatic application of penetrant materials is preferred because?
  - of the reduced risk of pollution
  - there is no progressive contamination of solutions
  - there is reduced dragout losses
  * all of the above

5) Some alloys are susceptible to corrosion or embrittlement due to the chemical action between the alloy and penetrant. This problem can be avoided after inspection by?
  - application of inhibitor
  - wrapping parts in plastic
  * post cleaning and inhibitor application
  - blowing down parts with compressed air

6) Which of the following discontinuities might be found in a welded fabrication?
  - Shrinkage.
  * Lack of fusion.
  - Seams.
  - Laps.

7) Which of the following is an advantage of solvent wipe methods over water washing?
  - No special lighting is necessary during inspection.
  - They provide a quicker penetration of small openings.
  - Small indications are more easily seen.
  * They can easily be carried out in the field/remote areas.

8) Which of the following discontinuities could be classified as an inherent discontinuity often found in cast material?
  - Fatigue crack.
  - Stress-corrosion crack.
  * Porosity.
  - Lack of penetration.

9) Of the methods listed below, the most effective means of precleaning a test item prior to a penetrant test is?
  * Vapour degreasing.
  - Detergent cleaning.
  - Steam cleaning.
  - Solvent wiping.

10) When conducting a penetrant test, spherical indications on the surface of a part could be indicative of?
  - Fatigue cracks.
  * Porosity.
  - Weld laps.
  - Hot tears.
